<#This project uses MINI-MAX algorithm to create an unbeatable Tic-Tac -Toe   AI Bot. -->


#TIC TAC TOE

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or X’s and O’s) is a paper and pencil game   for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in  horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. 


#MINI-MAX Algorithm

Minimax is a recursive algorithm which is used to choose an optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. As its name suggests, its goal is to minimize the maximum loss (minimize the worstcase scenario).

#HOW TO PLAY

Input for choice should be 1 or 2   and X or O
Input for action should be between 1-9.
If you have a key pad use it as a board to give the input, if not look at the dictionary mappings to give the input.

#GUI

Work in progess
