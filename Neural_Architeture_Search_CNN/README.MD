# THis is a Neural Architeture search rnn model whihc finds the perfect architeture for a cnn model given the possible hyperparameters.

Created to find the perfect architeture for a binary classification cnn model
LSTM model is used to generate the architeture
Once given the possible hyperparameters the model searches uses reinforcement learning for the gradient descent
